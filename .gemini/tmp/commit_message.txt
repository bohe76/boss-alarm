- fix: Correct all `no-unused-vars` and `no-dupe-keys` errors found during the initial linting pass.
- docs: Add new issue documents for the responsive design discussion and other known issues. Consolidate and refactor issue documentation.
- docs: Update GEMINI.md to include the new linting workflow and rules.
